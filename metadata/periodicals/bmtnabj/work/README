  There has been naming confusion about this title.  Last summer I took Maggie's
  spreadsheet metadata and created an xsl transform to generate mets
  and mods from it; unfortunately, it was filed as bmtnabh (Le
  Mercure/SIM) instead of bmtnabj (La Revue Musicale).

  I have moved the following files from bmtnabh:

  - Makefile
  - revuemusicale.xml
  - revuess2mods.xsl

  When the time comes, I'll need to work further with this
  spreadsheet and the transform to make it work.
