* A utility for creating derivatives from batches of TIFF files
  This project was forked from original work done by Jon Stroop.  Here
  are his notes:

** Stroop's ReadMe

   64 Bit ONLY!

   Dependencies:
   - Imagemagick (convert in particular). Configure the script so that
     the constants references convert by absolute path (output of
     `which`).
   - exiv2 VERSION 0.20 or GREATER.  Configure the script so that the
     constants references exiv2 by absolute path (output of `which`).
   - 64 bit Kakadu is included in lib. Other OSs will need to swap in
     appropriate libraries.

** CHANGES
*** [2013-01-03 Thu]
    (cew). Added method to derive LZW-compressed TIFFs from
    uncompressed originals via shellout to Imagemagick.
