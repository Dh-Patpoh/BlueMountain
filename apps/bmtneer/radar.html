        <p>Word clouds are a popular way of displaying the relative
frequency of string patterns in a corpus.  We say string patterns
and not words, because the concept of word is a complex one.
Nevertheless, word clouds are often used, for example, as a way
of quickly judging the relevance of a text to a particular
inquiry.  They can be a useful tool for quickly assessing the
“aboutness” of a text , or for comparing the distribution of
strings in different texts.</p>
        <p>The Blue Mountain Radar application will extract full-text
data from Blue Mountain’s XML database to produce word clouds at
various elevations: at the collection level, the title level, the
issue level, and the constituent level.  The application will
allow users to select multiple objects to compare (different
magazines, different issues, or different articles, for
example).</p>
