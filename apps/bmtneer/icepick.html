        <p>Information scientists and, increasingly, humanists studying
literature and history are using statistical methods to detect
meaningful patterns across large bodies of text through a
technique called topic modeling.  Although digitized newspapers
and periodicals have proven to be popular corpora for topic
modeling, the method’s usefulness is limited by the granularity
of the source documents: and in the case of mass-digitized
historical newspapers and magazines, entire issues, or even
entire volumes, become single documents.  Blue Mountain’s
structured metadata makes it simple to “unravel” the snaking
columns of text into discrete articles for topic analysis, like
the common analyses performed on the itemized digitized corpora
of scientific journals.</p>
        <p>The aggregation and clustering of content zones encoded in
METS/ALTO make it possible for topic modeling algorithms to
perform much more fine-grained analysis of magazines and
newspapers than they can perform using unzoned, “dirty-OCR’ed”
texts. Using Blue Mountain Icepick, researchers will be able to
study and compare the abstract topics occurring in the works of
two authors, for example, or to compare the topics in a
magazine’s articles with those in its advertising.</p>
