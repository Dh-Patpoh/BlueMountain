        <p>Researchers often want to see temporal or spatial patterns of
publication. Blue Mountain Maps will let them plot dates and
places of publication on interactive maps and timelines.</p>
        <p>Our bibliographic records already encode dates of publication
in a standard format (w3cdtf) and places of publication as they
appear in extant catalog records.  The prototype of Blue Mountain
Maps will use this already-existing data and off-the-shelf
software to allow users to plot and compare publication timelines
at various levels of granularity (author level, issue level, and
title level) and to plot places of publication on a spatial map,
using the Google Maps API.</p>
        <p>The final version of Blue Mountain Maps will integrate Blue
Mountain's data with date information gleaned from linked-data
sources to give Blue Mountain's resources more context.  It will
also use the results of automated named-entity recognition to
generate “aboutness maps” that can provide geospatial context for
articles and other forms of content in Blue Mountain's
magazines.</p>
