        <p>Tracing connections among people, be they speakers in a play or
contributors to a magazine, is a popular application of digital
technology to humanities research.  Blue Mountain’s bibliographic
metadata is unusually detailed: we have cataloged every issue to
the item level, which means we have recorded the title and
creator of every article, poem, and illustration.  The Blue
Mountain Carabiner tool will use that detailed metadata to let
users explore the complex webs of relations among titles,
authors, artists, languages, and nationalities. For example,
magazines often centered around coteries of writers or artists
whose composition often changed over the life of the magazine.
Being able to see how contributors clustered in a magazine can
make it possible to track the changing character, purpose, and
politics of a magazine. It is also useful to see the trajectory
of an individual’s contributions: when a writer was most
productive, for example, or when a writer shifted allegiance from
one magazine or group to another.</p>
