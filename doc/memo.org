* Memo: Bound Volumes
  In mid-April 2013 we encountered a problem with Bound volumes.  I
  wrote a spec for encoding metadata for bound volumes and
  hand-crafted detailed sample METS/MODS records to illustrate.
  Unfortunately, however, Veridian cannot handle this kind of data.

  Things stalled at that point, and I turned my attention to other
  matters.  Now Rady writes, asking that we resolve the "bound
  volumes" issue before DDD begins processing batch 3.


** Batch 3
   Batch 3 comprises the following titles:

   - Umělecký mĕsíčník (bmtnabk)
   - Klingen (bmtnaag)
   - Poesia bmtnaai
   - SIM bmtnabh

*** Umelecky (bmtnabk)
    The folders PUL has supplied DDD are arranged by issue; there are
    no volumes.


    

*** Klingen (bmtnaag)
    There are no volumes.
