* The Use of Heads in the Blue Mountain Project
  The typography used in the Blue Mountain texts varies enormously.
  Some of the typographical variety comes from avant-garde impulses
  -- the wish to break rules, to shock, to reimagine the function of
  type and art on the page.  But not all of the typography is
  avant-garde: much of it follows the conventions of newspaper and
  magazine printing.

  This memo is not a general introduction to typography; what I want
  to examine is the way the printers and designers of the magazines
  we are digitizing used *heads* to organize content, to make it
  easier for DDD's operators to understand how to zone and process
  the Blue Mountain magazines.

** Heads are Layout

  Printers have long used typography to organize content on a page.
  Sometimes they use horizontal or vertical lines of various widths
  (these are called /rules/); sometimes they use decorations
  (sometimes called /printer's ornaments/ or /dingbats/); sometimes
  they use variation in the spacing between lines and columns; and
  sometimes they use special text elements, called /heads/.

  It is very useful to think of heads this way, as layout and not as
  content.  Heads are used to organize content.  If you think of heads
  as typographical elements, just like rules and printer's ornaments,
  then you will be less disturbed by the large variety of heads and
  the promiscuous way they are employed, both within a single
  publication and across publication designs.

  Heads indicate the beginning of something -- that's why they are
  called heads.  Sometimes they indicate the beginning a new magazine
  constituent -- an article, a poem, or a section, for example.  These
  heads are sometimes called /headlines/ or /major heads/.  They are
  intended to draw the reader's eye to the beginning of something, so
  they are often printed in larger type, or in a bold font, or
  centered on the page or on a column, or separated from preceding and
  succeeding text with space or rules, or some combination of these.
  
  Headlines are often mistaken for /titles/: headlines are not titles.
  Headlines are typographical elements (having to do with layout);
  titles are textual elements (having to do with meaning).  So a
  headline may be used to print a title, but it is not the title.
  DocWorks implements rules that associate headlines (layout) with
  titles (text) to make it easier to extract constituent metadata
  (data about the constituent, like who wrote it and what it's
  called), but not all heads are titles.

  Designers often use heads to indicate hierarchical relationships
  among blocks of text.  For example, a designer may indicate that
  one block of text is part of a larger block of text by
  printing a smaller head at its top.  These smaller heads are
  sometimes called /subheads/, which is short for /subordinate
  heads/, because they are subordinate to a larger head.

  This is where things get difficult.

  Text blocks are /composable/: that is, they may be combined to form
  larger text blocks: a sequence of paragraphs may form an article,
  for example, and a sequence of articles may form a section.  Heads
  are often used as markers for composition (rules and printer's
  ornaments may serve the same function).  

  The problem arises when you try to pin down the /kind/ of
  relationship that exists among a set of text blocks.  The head at
  the beginning of a poem may be the headline of the poem, but also a
  subhead of a magazine section called "This Week's Poetry."  In
  docWorks, should that head be zoned as /headline/ or as
  /subheadline/?  It is not always easy to make a definitive,
  consistent determination.  The task is made easier, though, if we
  refine our understanding of text blocks by classifying them as
  /constituents/ or /components/.

** Constituents and Components
*** Constituents
   If a text block can stand on its own, it is a /constituent/.
   Examples of constituents:

   - Articles
   - Poems
   - Full-page illustrations
   - Many blocks of music
   - Many (but not all) partial-page illustrations with captions
   - Magazine sections
   - Items that appear in the table of contents, if there is one

   In the Blue Mountain docWorks processing workflow, constituents
   will end up being represented as <relatedItem type='constituent'>
   elements in the MODS record, and as <div TYPE='TextContent'> in
   the METS logical structMap.  Constituents may have headlines and
   bylines, but neither is required.

*** Components
    If a text block cannot stand on its own -- that is, if it is just
    a part of a larger block -- then it is a /component/.  Components
    may have heads, but it is not required.

*** Examples
**** A Simple Constituent
     /Le Grand Événement/ by Paul Fort (/L'Elan/, 15 April 1915)

     In docWorks, I believe this would look like this:
     - Chapter
       - Heading
	 - Headline
	   Le Grand Événement
	 - Byline
	   Paul Fort
       - Content

     In the logical structMap, it would be represented like this
     (edited for brevity):

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
       <div ID="L.1.1.2.5" TYPE="TextContent" ORDER="5" DMDID="c005" LABEL="LE GRAND ÉVÉNEMENT">

                     <area BETYPE="IDREF" FILEID="ALTO00005" BEGIN="P5_TB00005"/>

*** Guidelines
    How do you know when to zone a head as a headline and when to
    zone it as a subheadline?  Here's a general rule of thumb:    

    - Examine the head and its context.
    - If the text block below it is a /constituent/,
      - then zone the head as /headline/.
    - If the text block below it is a /component/,
      - then zone the head as /subheadline/.

    Deciding whether a text block is a constituent or a component can
    sometimes be difficult.  

    - Looking at the table of contents can often provide a clue: if
      the head appears in the table of contents, then it is certainly
      a headline and the text block below it is a constituent.

    - If the head does not appear in the table of contents, look to
      see if it is followed by a byline, or if a byline appears at
      the end of the text block it is associated with.  If a byline
      is present, the head should be zoned as a headline and the text
      block treated as a constituent.

    - Otherwise, you should probably treat the text block as a
      component, and zone the head as a subheadline.

*** A Difficult Example: /Poussières/, in /L'Elan/, January 1916
    Is this a single constituent, with the headline /Poussières/,
    containing two components, one with the subheadline /florilège
    cherfilial no. VI/ and the other with the subheadline /défense &
    illustration de la presse française/?  Or is it a constituent
    with two subconstituents?

    There is no table of contents for this issue of /L'Elan/, so
    that's no help.  There are no bylines, either for the text block
    headed by /Poussières/ or for the other two beneath it, which
    suggests that those two subsidiary blocks are components of a
    single constituent, and that their heads should be zoned as
    subheadlines.  That is a perfectly reasonable conclusion, and
    we would accept it.

    However, there is a clue that suggests another answer.  The first
    "subhead" is numbered: it is /florilège cherfilial/ number 6.
    That suggests it is part of a series, and indeed, if we look in
    /L'Elan/ from 15 December 1915 we find /florilège cherfilial
    no. V/, and /florilège cherfilial no. IV/ in the 1 July 1915
    issue.  We also see that /défense & illustration de la presse
    française/ is repeated in several issues.

    When a subsection repeats like this, from issue to issue, it is
    probably better to treat it as a subconstituent, with an entry in
    the MODS record and a label in the METS structMap, so readers who
    want to follow the series can locate it more easily.  So it would
    probably be better to zone this example as a first-level
    constituent with the headline /Poussières/, containing two
    second-level constituents, one with the headline /florilège
    cherfilial no. VI/ and the other with the headline /défense &
    illustration de la presse française/.
