* Identifiers and Naming Conventions
  Blue Mountain assigns a URI to each magazine, magazine issue,
  METS, and MODS record it maintains:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <BMTNPREFIX> ::= "urn:PUL:bluemountain"
  <DATESTRING> ::= CCYY-MM-DD | CCYY-MM | CCYY
  <ISSUEINDEX> ::= <0-9><0-9>
  <BMTNID>     ::= "bmtn" <a-z><a-z><a-z>
  <ISSUID>     ::= <BMTNID> "_" <DATESTRING> "_" <ISSUEINDEX>

  <TITLEURI>    ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":" <BMTNID>
  <ISSUEURI>    ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":" <ISSUEID>

  
  <TITLEMETSURI> ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":td:" <BMTNID>
  <ISSUEMETSURI> ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":td:" <ISSUEID>

  <TITLEMODSURI> ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":dmd:" <BMTNID>
  <ISSUEMODSURI> ::= <BMTNPREFIX> ":dmd:" <ISSUEID>
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  This syntax is explained below.

** Blue Mountain Identifiers (bmtnids)
  Blue Mountain is a /database/ of magazines: that is, it is a
  system that links information together.  In order to link
  information about specific objects -- magazine titles, magazine
  issues, ec. -- Blue Mountain must assign a /unique identifier/ to
  each object.  (This is a well-known feature of information
  science.).

  Blue Mountain adopts the Universal Resource Name conventions (URN)
  to compose unique identifiers for /titles/ and /issues/, as well
  as for the metadata records (METS and MODS) used to encode
  information about them. 

   A /Journal Title/ is the journal or magazine as a whole, as
   opposed to discrete volumes or issues -- the entire run of the
   magazine.  Blue Mountain assigns a sequential /blue mountain
   identifier/, or /bmtnid/ to each title.  The bmtnid will take the
   form /bmtnNNN/, where NNN is a hexavigesimal number (e.g., /aaa/,
   /aab/, /aac/, etc.).[fn:1] Blue Mountain will maintain bmtnids in a
   /project registry/, a file maintained with other administrative
   files.

** Issuance Strings
   Each journal /issue/ will be assigned an /issue identifier/ or
   /issueid/ of the form /bmtnid_issuanceString/, where /issuanceString/
   corresponds to the date of issuance and takes the form
   /CCYY-MM-DD_II/, defined as follows:

   - CCYY :: A four-digit number representing the year of publication (e.g., 1912)
   - MM   :: A two-digit number representing the month of publication,
	     where January = 01, February = 02, etc.
   - DD   :: A two-digit number representing the day of publication
	     (e.g., 01, 02 .. 30, 31).
   - II   :: A two-digit index of daily issuance (e.g., the first
	     issue of the day is 01, the second is 02, and so on).
	     This convention is adopted from the issuance of
	     newspapers, which not infrequently issued a morning
	     edition and an evening edition on the same day.  Blue
	     Mountain's adoption allows us to distinguish among
	     magazine texts that were published on the same day: a
	     regular issue and a supplement, for example.

*** How to Compose an Issuance String
    Issueids, like ISO 8601 dates, are organized from most
    significant to least significant chronological unit (i.e., from
    year to day).  This format has two advantages: it allows ids to
    be sorted naturally, and it enables /variable precision/: the
    representation of daily, monthly, or yearly issuance.

    - If you know the year, month, and day of publication (e.g., you
      know that the issue was published on January 5th, 1912) :: then
      the issuance string os 1912-01-05_01.

    - If you have two issues published on the same day (e.g., an
      issue and a special supplement were both issued on January
      5th, 1912) :: then the issuance strings are 1912-01-05_01 and
      1912-01-05_02.

    - If you know only the year and month of publication (e.g., you
      know it was published in January, 1912, but you do not know on
      what day: 1912-01_01.

    - If you know that the magazine published two issues monthly, but
      you do not know the dates of publication (e.g., you have two
      issues published in January, 1912): The issuance strings are
      1912-01_01 and 1912-01_02.

    - If you know only the year of publication (e.g., you know that
      the issue was published in 1912, but you do not know the month
      or, therefore, the day of publication): The issuance string is
      1912_01.

    - If you have several issues published in the same year, but you
      know neither the month nor the day of publication (e.g., you
      know the journal published two issues in 1912, but you do not
      know the months or days of publication): The issuance strings
      are 1912_01 and 1912_02.

**** A Real Example
    The journal /le coeur Ã  barbe/ has the Blue Mountain
    identifier *bmtnaad*.  Only one issue was published, in April
    of 1920.

    |---------------+---------------------------------------------|


** File Names
   Names of Blue Mountain files will be constructed using the naming
   convention described above.
*** Image File Names
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <EXTENSION> ::= "tif" | "jp2"
    <IMGINDEX>  ::= <0-9><0-9><0-9>
    <FILENAME>  ::= <ISSUEID> "_" <IMGINDEX> "." <EXTENSION>
    #+END_EXAMPLE

   Image files shall be named /issueid_nnn.jp2/ or /issueid_nnn.tif/,
   where
   - /issuid/ is the identifier of the issue;
   - /nnn/ is a three-digit number indicating the location of the
     image file in the sequence of image files (not necessarily the
     number printed on the page that has been photographed);
   - /jp2/ is the conventional file extension for JPEG2000 files.
   - /tif/ is the conventional file extension for TIFF files.

   For example,
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01_001.jp2
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01_002.jp2
   ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE
*** ALTO File Names
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <EXTENSION> ::= "alto.xml"
    <IMGINDEX>  ::= <0-9><0-9><0-9>
    <FILENAME>  ::= <ISSUEID> "_" <IMGINDEX> "." <EXTENSION>
    #+END_EXAMPLE

   ALTO files shall be named /issueid_nnn.alto.xml/, where
   - /issuid/ is the identifier of the issue
   - /nnn/ is a three-digit number corresponding to the sequence
     number of the image file to which this ALTO file corresponds
   - /alto/ indicates the schema used to encode the document
   - /xml/ indicates the format of the file.

   For example,
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01_001.alto.xml
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01_002.alto.xml
   ...
   #+END_EXAMPLE
*** METS File Names
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <EXTENSION> ::= "mets.xml"
    <FILENAME>  ::= <ISSUEID>  "." <EXTENSION>
    #+END_EXAMPLE

   METS files shall be named /issueid.mets.xml/, where
   - /issueid/ is the identifier of the issue
   - /mets/ indicates the schema used to encode the document
   - /xml/ indicates the format of the file.
   
   For example,
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01.mets.xml
   #+END_EXAMPLE
*** PDF File Names
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <EXTENSION> ::= "pdf"
    <FILENAME>  ::= <ISSUEID> "." <EXTENSION>
    #+END_EXAMPLE

   PDF files shall be named /issueid.pdf/, where
   - /issueid/ is the identifier of the issue
   - /pdf/ indicates the format of the file.
   
   For example,
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01.pdf
   #+END_EXAMPLE

* Journal Objects
 A /journal object/ will comprise the following elements:

 - title-level descriptive metadata :: A detailed, machine-readable
      description of the periodical as a whole.  Encoded in MODS for
      compatibility with library systems, but translatable into other
      formats (e.g., TEI).

 - title-level bibliography :: An article-level prose description.
      (/bmtnid.tei.xml/)

 - title-level metadata wrapper :: Pulls together the title-level
      metadata, the bibliography, and the issue-level metadata
      (/bmtnid.mets.xml/)

 - issues :: one or more issues, each of which entails the following:
   - preservation-quality images :: high-quality TIFF files ('master
	TIFFs'), produced according to local best practices and in
	conformance with the FADGI standards
	(http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-technical.html).
   - generative image derivatives :: more manageable forms of the
	master TIFFs, meant to serve as the source for online
	deliverables, etc.  Encoded in the JPEG2000 format, according
	to specifications described below.
   - delivery derivatives :: images optimized for delivery over the
	World Wide Web.
   - issue-level descriptive metadata :: a MODS document (see below).
   - text encodings :: Initially these will be in the form of
		       corrected OCR for each page, encoded in the
		       ALTO schema (output by ABBYY via
		       docWORKS). Future encodings will likely
		       include TEI representations, derived from the
		       ALTO documents, for detailed textual analysis.
   - deliverable text-under-image PDF :: another ABBYY output format.
   - issue-level metadata wrapper :: a METS document.  The METS half
	of METS/ALTO, the structMap of this document links
	constituent-level items to the regions identified in the ALTO
	documents, and to the page image.  (See below for detailed
	specification.)
* Arrangement (Blue Mountain Directory Structure)
  The components of the journal object have different storage and
  access requirements.  Master TIFF files are very large binary
  files that will seldom be accessed but must be carefully preserved
  (they are expensive or impossible to replace). Image derivatives,
  too, are large binary files, but they can be regenerated from the
  master TIFFs and therefore require less care, but they will be
  accessed from a variety of sources (primarily the web).  PDF files
  are hybrids: they are large binary files, composites of image
  derivatives and OCR output that cannot easily be recreated and so
  must be preserved more carefully than image derivatives while
  still being accessible.  Metadata files are relatively small but
  very expensive to replace, and so must be curated carefully.  They
  are also liable to updating, so version tracking is important.

  The Blue Mountain Project will manage these assets separately.
  The non-binary data and metadata will be stored and managed in a
  distributed version control system (DVCS), which will enable
  change management, collaborative development among PUL and its
  METS/ALTO vendor, and resource sharing, as stipulated in the
  grant.

  Master TIFF files and text-under-image PDFs will be maintained in a
  /preservation store/; image derivatives, and copies of the PDFs and
  the metadata, will be kept in an /access store./
** The Metadata Store
   Metadata will be organized as a hierarchy of files and
   directories, like this:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - periodicals/
     - bmtnID/
       - bmtnID.mets.xml
       - bmtnID.mods.xml
       - bmtnID.tei.xml
       - issues/
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   The issues/ directory will be organized by publication date,
   following the same convention as that used for constructing
   identifiers.  So, for example,
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - bmtnabi/
     - issues/
       - 1859/
	 - 01/
	   - 05_01/
	     - bmtnid_issueid.mets.xml
	     - bmtnid_issueid.mods.xml
	     - bmtnid_issueid.tei.xml
	     - alto/
	       - bmtnid_issueid-001.alto.xml
	       - bmtnid_issueid-002.alto.xml
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** The Preservation Store
   The Preservation Store will be arranged as a filesystem mirroring
   the structure of the metadata tree and rooted at
   /usr/share/BlueMountain/pstore/periodicals.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - pstore/
     - periodicals/
       - bmtnid/
	 - issues/
	   - CCYY/
	     - MM/
	       - DD_II/
		 - bmtnid_issueid.pdf
		 - bmtnid_issueid_001.tif
		 - bmtnid_issueid_002.tif
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** The Access Store
   Like the Preservation Store, the Access store will be arranged as
   a filesystem mirroring the structure of the metadata tree; it will
   be rooted at /usr/share/BlueMountain/astore/periodicals.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - astore/
     - periodicals/
       - bmtnid/
	 - issues/
	   - CCYY/
	     - MM/
	       - DD_II/
		 - bmtnid_issueid.pdf
		 - generative/
		   - bmtnid_issueid_001.jp2
		   - bmtnid_issueid_002.jp2
		   - bmtnid_issueid_003.jp2
		 - delivery/
		   - bmtnid_issueid_001.jp2
		   - bmtnid_issueid_002.jp2
		   - bmtnid_issueid_003.jp2
   #+END_EXAMPLE

* Profiles
** METS Profile
   There are two kinds of METS records in Blue Mountain:

   1. *Title-Level METS* -- A METS document encapsulating information about
      the magazine title as a whole.
   2. *Issue-Level METS* -- A METS document encapsulating information
      about an individual issue of a magazine.

   These are described in greater detail below.

*** Title-Level METS
    ( Greater detail to come. )

    The metadata for the title will be encapsulated in a title-level
    METS record: the title-level descriptive metadata (either as an
    embedded MODS record or pointed to), a pointer to the
    bibliographic history, and (possibly) pointers to issue-level metadata.

*** Issue-Level METS
   The metadata for each issue shall be encapsulated in a METS
   record.  A skeleton sample of such a record is the following:

     The fileSec comprises two /<fileGrp>/ elements: one for the
     images and one for the ALTO records.
***** <fileGrp ID="IMGGRP" USE="Images">
      The /IMGGRP/ file group contains <file> elements that indicate
      the location of each image file, with attributes linking the

      corresponding ALTO file.
****** <file>
      - /ID/ :: a unique XML id
      - AMDID :: the ID of the /<techmd>/ element corresponding to the

**** <structMap>
     The <structMap> element describes a hierarchical arrangement of
     the parts (<div>s) making up the digital object described by the
     METS.  For this project, there are two kinds: a /physical
     structMap/, which delineates the pages of the newspaper issue in
     reading order, and a /logical structMap/, which functions as an
     outline of the newspaper's contents.  Both of these are assembled
     by docWorks, using configuration rules.

       	as a separate digital object, so the <div TYPE="Volume">
       	element will in practice contain only one <div TYPE="Issue">.

       	Attributes:
       	- TYPE :: must be "VOLUME"
       	- LABEL :: The volume caption, if present
******* <div TYPE="Issue">
       	A <div> representing the actual issue.  It contains the
       	"contents" of the paper: the editorial content and the
       	advertisements.

       	The Issue <div> contains, in most cases, three sub-<div>s: <div
       	TYPE="PublicationInfo">, <div TYPE="EditorialContent"> and <div
       	TYPE="SponsoredAdvertisements">, described below.
******* <div TYPE="PublicationInfo">
       	Contains <div>s corresponding to the metadata about the

       	folio lines, page numbers, etc.
******* <div TYPE="EditorialContent" LABEL="Contents">
       	Contains <div>s corresponding to the TextContent and
       	Illustration elements, in publication order.  These elements

******* <div TYPE="Header">
       	A <div> containing the component's (the TextContent, SponsoredAd,

** MODS Profile
   There are two kinds of MODS records in Blue Mountain:

   1. Title-level MODS
   2. Issue-level MODS

*** Title-Level MODS
    The descriptive metadata for most, if not all, of the Blue
    Mountain titles has been taken from MARC records retrieved from
    Princeton's OPAC and machine-converted, then edited and enhanced
    by hand.  Here is a sample:

    #+END_SRC
    - The MODS record contains an [[(identifer)][<identifier>]] element whose type is
      /bmtn/.  Its value is a URN for the title, which is of the form

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      where the string /urn:PUL:bluemountain/ is constant (for all
      Blue Mountain URNs) and /BMTNID/ is the Blue Mountain project
      identifier of the periodical.

    - The MODS record also contains a <recordInfo> element, which
      provides a link back to the original OPAC record, as well as a
      [[(ridentifier)][<recordIdentifier>]] uniquely identifying the record itself; it is
      simply the journal URN with /dmd/ inserted into the identifier:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - The <name> elements are associated with authorities to enhance
      search and broaden the interconnectedness of the
      data.  http://viaf.org is the preferred authority;
      http://id.loc.gov should be consulted when a name is not found
      in viaf.org; if a name is found in neither, a local authority
      will be created (To be determined later).
    - Dates are encoded in ISO standard 8601 format (see
      http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874; for an
      overview see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).  The
      extended form of the representation is preferred.
    - Subject headings will conform with existing standards in a
      manner yet to be determined.
*** Issue-Level MODS
    Blue Mountain encodes descriptive metadata for the contents of
    each magazine issue, so the issues may be searched and analyzed.

**** <mods>
     The root element of the document.  When output as a stand-alone
     document, it has fixed attributes, as illustrated below:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <mods xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

             http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3/mods-3-4.xsd">
     #+END_SRC
**** <recordInfo>
     The <recordInfo> element contains information about the MODS
     record itself.  It shall contain a /<recordIdentifier>/ element, as
     below.
**** <recordIdentifier>
     The <recordIdentifier> element contains the ISSUEMODSURI, the
     unique identifier for the MODS record itself, as described above.
**** <identifier type="PUL">
     The <identifier> element is used to identify the resource the MODS
     record describes (the magazine issue).  Its value is the
     resource's ISSUEURI, as described above.
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <identifier type="PUL">urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaad_1925-06-03_01</identifier>
     #+END_SRC
**** <relatedItem type="host">
     Each issue-level MODS record is related to the
     title-level record /via/ a <relatedItem type='host'> element.

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
      <relatedItem type="host" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="urn:PUL:bluemountain:PUBID">

	  <recordIdentifier>urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:PUBID</recordIdentifier>
       	</recordInfo>
      </relatedItem>
     #+END_SRC

     where /PUBID/ is the publication identifier of the title.

     The xlink:href shows the semantic relation between the issue and
     its host; the <recordIdentifier> is a specific key to the
     title-level record.

**** <language>
     The <language> element(s) indicates the language of the resource
     (the magazine issue).  If the issue contains material written in
     several languages, the record should include a <language>
     element for each one.  The value of the <languageTerm> element
     must be drawn from iso639-2b.  For example:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <language>
       <languageTerm type="code" authority="iso639-2b">rus</languageTerm>
      </language>
     #+END_SRC
**** <titleInfo>
     The <MODS:titleInfo> element shall be determined by standard
     cataloging rules.

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <titleInfo>
       <nonSort>Le</nonSort>

       <subTitle>journal transparent</subTitle>
     </titleInfo>
     #+END_SRC
**** <MODS:part>
     The <MODS:part> element shall take the following form:

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:part>
      <MODS:detail type="volume">...</MODS:detail>
      <MODS:detail type="issue">...</MODS:detail>

	<MODS:caption>Vol. MASTHEADVOL</MODS:caption>
      </MODS:detail>
      #+END_SRC
      Where
      - ARABICVOL is the volume number expressed as a non-formatted arabic numeral (e.g., 1, 2, 3,
       ... 10, 11, ...)
      - MASTHEADVOL is the volume number as it appears in the
	masthead.
***** <MODS:detail type="issue">
      The <MODS:detail type="issue"> element shall take one of two possible
      forms:
      - For "normal" issues (i.e., those following the recorded
	sequence of publication), record both the sequential number of
	the issue as an arabic numeral and the issue number as it
	appears in the masthead:
	#+BEGIN_SRC xml
	<MODS:detail type="issue">
	 <MODS:number>ARABICISSUE</MODS:number>
	 <MODS:caption>No. MASTHEADISSUE</MODS:caption>
	</MODS:detail>
	#+END_SRC
	Where
	- ARABICISSUE is the issue number expressed as a non-formatted arabic numeral
	  (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, ...)
	- MASTHEADISSUE is the volume number as it appears in the
	  masthead. 
      - For "special" issues (e.g., supplements, etc.), for which there is no sequential number for the
	issue, the <MODS:detail type="issue"> element should take the
	following form:
	#+BEGIN_SRC xml
	<MODS:detail type="issue">
	 <MODS:caption>CAPTIONTEXT</MODS:caption>
	</MODS:detail>
	#+END_SRC
	Where /CAPTIONTEXT/ is determined using standard cataloging rules.




**** <MODS:originInfo>
     The <MODS:originInfo> element shall be used to record the date of
     issuance, as follows:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:originInfo>
      <MODS:dateIssued>PRINTEDDATE</MODS:dateIssued>
      <MODS:dateIssued encoding="iso8601" keyDate="yes">ISODATE</MODS:dateIssued>
     </MODS:originInfo>
     #+END_SRC
     Where
     - /PRINTEDDATE/ is the date as it appears in the cover page
       FolioLine, or in the Masthead.
     - /ISODATE/ is the value of the date in the masthead, expressed
       in iso8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) -- see
       http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime for details.


*** <relatedItem type="constituent">
     Traditional library cataloging does not extend to the contents
     of periodicals, yet this level of description is precisely what
     is required by scholars of periodicals, and the Blue
     Mountain Project is committed to providing it, as well as to
     formulating guidelines, in cooperation with scholars and
     librarians, for this level of description.  The specifications
     for this description, therefore, must be considered work in
     progress, work that will necessarily evolve over the course of
     the Project.

     That being said, the Project will, at the outset, capture
     information about the following sorts of constituents:

     - traditional editorial content (articles, features, letters to the
       editor, etc.)
     - significant illustrations (figures, tip-ins, etc.)
     - advertisements

     The last sort -- advertisements -- is the most controversial,
     and the most difficult for librarians to understand, although
     advertisements are among the most heavily studied parts of
     historical periodicals.  There are at present no established
     rules for describing advertisements, and their variety and
     abundance pose serious practical challenges to projects with
     limited resources.  This version of the specification,
     therefore, provides little guidance on the description of
     periodicals, other than providing a framework for this level of
     detail to be created at a future date, by scholars, researchers,
     and other students of the material who wish to advance
     scholarship by enhancing the data provided here.

   - TextContent
   - Illustration
   - SponsoredAd
   - Section

   They are described in greater detail below.

   Here is a hypothetical example, in English:
   #+BEGIN_SRC xml
<relatedItem type="constituent" ID="c17">
  <titleInfo>
   <nonSort>A</nonSort>
   <title>Modest Proposal</title>

   </extent>
  </part>
  <genre type="CCS">TextContent</genre>
 </relatedItem>
   #+END_SRC

   - The /type/ attribute has the value /constituent/, because this
     related item is a constituent (a part) of the newspaper.

   - The /ID/ attribute may be any valid XML ID (it must begin with a
     character).  By convention, the ID will begin with the letter /c/
     followed by a sequential number.  (The docWorks processing flow
     seems to generate the /ID/ attributes.)  This attribute links the
     description to a <div> element in the METS logical structMap.

**** <titleInfo>
     The <title> is transcribed as it appears on the page, using
     standard cataloging rules.
**** <name>
    - The <name> elements (there may none, or there may be more than
      one) are used to record the names of the people or organizations
      who are responsible for the constituent -- usually, this is
      simply the author of the piece.

      The /<name>/ is transcribed as it appears on the page and is
      encoded in the /<displayForm>/ element.  All /<name>/ elements
      shall include a /<role>/ element, which shall designate the
      generic role, /cre/, in the /<roleTerm>/ subelement.

      When possible, encoders should supply a link to a name
      authority, preferably http://viaf.org.  
**** <language>
    - The language used in the text.  If more than one language is
      used, there should be a <language> element for each.
    - The <language> element shall contain the subelement
      /<languageTerm>/, a three-letter code derived from the ISO639-2
      standard, found at http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/.  The
      code form should be used.
**** <part>
     Contains a single <extent> element.
***** <extent unit="page">
     - The <extent> records the page or pages on which the constituent appears:
       - when the item appears on a single page ::
	    encode the page number as a solitary /<start>/ element.
	    #+BEGIN_SRC xml
	    <extent unit="page">
             <start>3</start>
            </extent>
	    #+END_SRC

       - when the item appears on multiple sequential pages :: 
	    encode the first page in a /<start>/ element and the last
            page in an /<end>/ element.
	    #+BEGIN_SRC xml
	    <extent unit="page">
             <start>3</start>
             <end>4</end>
            </extent>
	    #+END_SRC

       - when the item appears on non-sequential pages :: 
	    encode the pages as a series in a /<list>/ element, as in
	    #+BEGIN_SRC xml

**** <genre type="CCS">
     The /<genre type="CCS">/ is determined from the docWorks configuration: for
     articles and other editorial content, it will be /TextContent/;
     for photographs, cartoons, and other illustrations, it will be
     /Illustration/; for advertisements, is will be /SponsoredAd/.
     Those <relatedItem type="constituent"> elements that contain
     /other/ constituents will have the genre /Section/.
**** Kinds of Constituents
***** TextContent
      These are the most common sorts of constituents: articles,
      notices, poems, stories, sports scores -- all textual editorial
      content.

      A TextContent constituent may contain /other constituents/: in
      particular, an article may contain illustrations.

***** Illustration
      We use /Illustration/ to refer to all kinds of graphic "art":
      photographs, cartoons, charts, etc.  Most illustrations in
      /Vozrozhdenie/ (but not all) are accompanied by some sort of
      /caption/: a line or two of text, usually beneath the graphic,
      that describes the illustration, or names the creator of the
      illustration, or both.

      For docWorks processing, the caption should be used as the
      <title>.

** ALTO Profile
   For each page, an encoded representation of the layout and the
   machine-readable text on the page shall be provided, using the
   ALTO schema, version 2.0 or higher, with the following
   specifications, adopted from the NDNP:

   - The text shall be encoded in the natural reading order of the
     language in which the text is written;
   - Point size and font data to at least the word level shall be included;
   - The ALTO file shall include bounding-box coordinates to at least
     the word level;
   - Non-rectangular blocks shall not be used.  Some illustrations
     may format as "tight" in the document.
** Image Profiles
*** TIFF: Image Description
    In general, Princeton University Library adheres to the standards
    elaborated by the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines
    Initiative (FADGI), whose Still Image Working Group produced
    a document entitled /Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Cultural
    Heritage Materials/ in 2010.  Archival images will be captured in
    24-bit RGB and digitally rendered at varying resolutions to produce
    a uniform long dimension of 7200 pixels, then stored as
    uncompressed TIFF files with a large, non-proprietary color profile
    (Pro Photo RGB). The homogenization of the archival files to a long
    dimension of 7200 pixels allows us to produce uniform derivative
    images rapidly and estimate our storage needs more accurately.
*** JPEG2000: Image Description
**** Generative Image Derivatives

* General Markup Policy for Blue Mountain Magazines
** Preliminary
   For each title, Princeton will provide the following:

   1. A "sample copy markup" (PDF): a full issue marked up according
      to the General Markup Policy;
   2. A title-specific markup addendum clarifying unusual zoning and
      structural features; and
   3. A marked up copy of any issue(s) deviating substantially from
      either the general or title-specific markup policies.

** VerifyPageFrames (VPF)
   Straighten and deskew all pages.  When the input files include
   two-page spreads, do not split them into separate files unless
   instructed.
** VerifyLayoutElements (VLE)
   The VLE step is skipped for serials and books, so zoning is
   performed in VPN.
** VerifyPageNumbers (VPN)
   It is important to refer to any sample copy markup and any
   title-specific markup addenda in addition to this document, as the
   location and ways of identifying zones will vary by publication.
*** Zone Types to Tag
**** PubInfo Container
***** Page Number
      - Zone Name (in docWorks) :: PageNumber
      - Description :: Used when the publication includes page numbers
      - Location and Features :: Varies by publication; consult
	   addenda.
***** Nameplate
      - Zone Name (docWorks) :: Nameplate
      - Description :: The space at the top of the magazine cover,
		       usually containing the name (the logo),
		       location, volume, issue, and sometimes
		       taglines.  Designs range from simple to
		       intricate, depending on the design of the publication.
      - Location and Features :: The nameplate often contains the same
	   information as the /masthead/ but is a different layout
	   element.  Its purpose is to make the magazine identifiable
	   when seen from a distance (as at a magazine stand, for
	   example).  The typeface is often a custom display type.

	   Not every publication design includes a recognizable
	   nameplate.
***** Masthead
      - Zone Name (docWorks) :: Masthead
      - Description :: A section inside the magazine containing
		       various pieces of publication information, such
		       as the editor's names, contact information, and
		       subscription rates.
      - Location and Features :: Mastheads vary in size and amount of
	   information included.  Some may take up an entire page.
	   In newspapers, the masthead often occurs on the editorial
	   page; in magazines, it may appear in various locations
	   (consult title-specfic mark-up addenda).
***** Folio Line (Inside)
      - Zone Name :: InsideFolioLine
      - Description :: A folio line is an identification line,
		       appearing (when it does appear) on each page of
		       a newspaper or magazine.  The front-page folio
		       line is different from those on inside pages.
      - Location and Features :: Not all magazine layouts feature a
	   folio line.  It may run at the top or bottom of each page.
	   It can also run as part of the logo on special pages or
	   within the masthead.  It often consists of the publication
	   date in one corner, the name of the publication (centered),
	   and the page number in the other corner.  It is sometimes
	   separated from the rest of the page by a cutoff rule.
***** Front Folio Line(s)
      - Zone Name :: FrontFolioLine
      - Description :: An identification line or lines on cover of the
		       magazine often containing one or more of the
		       following elements: the volume number
		       (or the number of years the publication has
		       been in print); the issue number; the place of
		       publication; and date of publication.
      - Location and Features :: Usually joins the nameplate. Often
	   separated from the logo by borders or cutoff rules.

	   Not every publication layout includes a recognizable front
	   folio line.  Many of the Blue Mountain designs omit it, or
	   scatter the informaiton traditionally contained in a front
	   folio line across the front page.
***** General Publication Information
      - Zone Name :: GenericPubInfo
      - Description :: A catch-all category for other "metadata" about
		       the magazine not identifiable as nameplate,
		       masthead, or folio lines.
      - Location and Features :: Highly variable, but usually found on
	   outside or inside covers.  Consult title-specific addenda.
**** Editorial Content Container
***** Head
      - Zone Name :: Headline
      - Description :: A phrase at the beginning of a magazine
		       section, usually indicating the subject of the
		       following copy text.
      - Location and Features :: A newspaper /headline/ is a /kind/ of
	   head; magazines usually have many other kinds of
	   heads. /Heads/ are usually recognizable by weight, size, or
	   position of type: they are often heavier or larger, and are
	   often (though not always) centered above one or more
	   columns of type with space before and after.  A single
	   magazine constituent may have several /levels/ of heading:
	   most have a top-level head (usually the title of the
	   piece), to distinguish the piece as a whole from other
	   magazine content, but many have typographically distinct
	   /subheads/ that subdivide the constituent itself into
	   sections (see /Subhead/ below).
***** Subhead
      - Zone Name :: Subheadline
      - Description :: A phrase demarcating a part of a constituent
		       or section of a magazine. A constituent or
		       section cannot have a subhead without a head.
      - Location and Features :: Subheads break up a chunk (a
	   constituent, a section) into smaller units.  Subheads are
	   usually distinguished typographically from heads by smaller
	   type sizes and different spacing.
***** Article Copy
      - Zone Name :: Textblock
      - Description :: A block of body text. /Article Copy/ is a
		       misnomer; /Editorial Copy/ would be better.
		       It is usually, though not always, divided into
		       paragraphs; Blue Mountain zones tables and
		       lists as Article Copy.
      - Location and Features :: May be preceded by a Head (though a
	   Head is not mandatory).  May be subdivided into smaller
	   units through the use of rules and/or subheads.
      - Tagging Notes :: 
	- Blue Mountain zones tables and lists as
	  Article Copy.
	- Blue Mountain also tags tables of contents as Article Copy.
***** Byline
      - Zone Name :: Author
      - Description :: A zone containing one or more regions
		       associated with the writer of an article,
		       musical composition, letter, or other editorial
		       content: usually the writer's name, but
		       sometimes also the writer's position or other
		       biographical information.
      - Location and Features :: The byline is usually located either
	   at the beginning of the content, between the head and the
	   first zone of copy, or at the end of the copy text.
	   Bylines can be difficult to distinguish.  They are
	   sometimes set in italic or boldfaced type or in all-caps;
	   they are sometimes a full name (first name, last name),
	   sometimes a last name only, or one or two initials, or a
	   name with a term of address in the language of the
	   magazine (Mr., Dr., Madame, M., Herr, etc.)
***** Art
      - Zone Name :: Illustration
      - Description :: A drawing, photograph, a reproduction of a
		       print or a painting; a graphic poem.
		       Sometimes has a caption above, below, or to
		       the side of it.
      - Location and Features :: May occur anywhere; may occupy a
	   single column, several columns, or be set outside the
	   column grid of the page; or may take up a full page or a
	   multi-page spread.

	   The Avant-garde saw the invention of "graphical text" like
	   concrete poetry, shape poetry, Futurist "words in
	   liberty," etc.  While these are in fact hybrid forms, both
	   graphic and text, Blue Mountain zones them as art.		     
***** Caption
      - Zone Name :: Caption
      - Description :: One or more textual blocks associated with an
		       Illustration.
      - Location and Features :: Captions may appear above, below, or
	   (occasionally) to the side of the illustration to which
	   they belong.  They may contain several lines and/or zones
	   of information: the identity of the subject; the name of
	   the artist/photographer/poet; the title of the artwork
	   being printed or reproduced.  Consult title-specific
	   addenda.
***** Music
      - Zone Name :: Music
      - Description :: A zone of musical notation (in Western music,
		       most often one or more staves, perhaps with
		       clefs and key signatures, and notes; sometimes
		       heavily annotated with text.)
      - Location and Features :: Size and extent varies.  May be a
	   small musical example occupying a few lines of a column,
	   or a multi-page musical compostion.  Some zones of music
	   may be accompanied by heads or captions.
***** Footnote
      - Zone Name :: Footnote
      - Description :: A zone of type, usually at the foot of the
		       page, serving as an annotation to some text on
		       the page.
      - NOTE :: This zone is under consideration.
**** SponsoredAd Container
***** Sponsored Ad (Advertisement Copy)
      - Zone Name :: Advertisement
      - Description :: An often-heterogenous zone of mixed
		       typography, graphics, and layout whose
		       function is to draw attention to some event,
		       product, or service.  /Sponsored/
		       advertisements are those advertisements that
		       appear in the magazine because an outside
		       agency (a company, a theater, a publisher) has
		       paid for it to appear.
      - Location and Description :: Ads may appear anywhere, but most
	   often they appear in groups at the end of a magazine
	   issue.  They are often boxed.  They may be any size --
	   from a few inches to a partial or full page.

*** Zone Types to Ignore
    - Rules :: Do not zone horizontal and vertical rules -- the
	       (usually thin) lines used to separate regions of the page.
    - Ornamental Artwork :: Typographer's ornaments, ornamental
	 borders, anonymous graphics at the heads of sections.
	 (Consult title-specific addenda.)
** VerifyPageHierarchy (VPH)
   Add the following metadata, if available:

   - Volume Number
   - Issue Number
   - Issue Date
   - Publication Title

   This information will always be supplied by Princeton in the form
   of /preliminary issue-level MODS/ (see below).
** VerifyHiearchy (VH)
   Identify all components as either PubInfo, EditorialContent, or
   SponsoredAds.

   - Classify all zones in PubInfo or Editorial Content containers
     manually.  (All ad zones will be grouped automatically into
     SponsoredAd containers.)
   - Composition of magazine constituents is highly variable.  Some
     general guidelines:
     - A constituent very often is composed of a head, a byline, and
       one or more sections of body copy.  Look for a typographically
       distinct head to begin the constituent; a byline will
       sometimes follow immediately after the head, but it may also
       appear at the very end.
     - Use the head as the constituent's title.
     - Many of the Blue Mountain titles are art magazines; the illustrations
       often have heads, captions, and bylines. If a head is present,
       treat it as the title.
** OCR Correction
   - Correct all heads, subheads, bylines, and captions.
   - Delete empty zones.
   - Ignore hand-written text blocks.
