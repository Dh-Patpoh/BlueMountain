  <abstract>
   <para>The Statement of Work agreement between Princeton University Library (PUL) and Digital
    Divide Data (DDD) for the remaining portion of the Blue Mountain Project, Phase I. It supercedes
    all prior statements of work and production schedules, whether produced by DDD or by PUL, in
    whatever form.</para>

 <sect1>
  <title>Rationale</title>

  <para>The total page count for Blue Mountain, Phase I is approximately 92,305. The grant cycle for
   Phase I ends on September 1, 2014, and production should be completed well before then. The
   following schedule, then, is based on 7 two-month production cycles for Digital Divide Data,
   where a cycle is defined in the plan of work below. </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Reference Documents</title>
  <para> The Blue Mountain Project has detailed its policies, requirements, and formats in a series
   of reference documents maintained and distributed on the <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/pulibrary/BlueMountain/wiki">Blue Mountain wiki</link> at the
   Blue Mountain Project's GitHub portal <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/pulibrary/BlueMountain"
    >https://github.com/pulibrary/BlueMountain</link>. </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Plan of Work</title>
  <para>The Work shall be divided into discrete units (hereafter referred to as batches, deliveries,
   or tranches), as defined in the section below. Processing of each unit shall follow this
   procedure: </para>

  <procedure>
   <title>Processing Procedure</title>

   <step>
    <para>For each unit, PUL shall provide DDD with the following items:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <formalpara>
       <title>LZW-Compressed TIFF Files</title>
       <para>For each title, PUL shall provide image files in the format specified in the reference
        document. PUL shall arrange these image files into systems of directories (folders)
        organized by date of publication, as specified in the reference document. Princeton shall
        make every reasonable effort to ensure these issue sets are accurate and complete. If, upon
        DDD's inspection at receipt, there are missing pages, duplicate pages, or other
        directory-level or file-level anomalies which impede or otherwise interfere with DDD's
        subsequent processing of the materials, DDD shall inform Princeton immediately for remedy.
        Princeton shall not be responsible for redundant work performed by DDD in remedy of such
        anomalies. These page-image files shall be delivered via one of two media, subject to
        negotiation: <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>File transfer via FTP. This is preferred. Princeton shall provide an FTP portal for
           this purpose.</para>
         </listitem>

         <listitem>
          <para>Portable hard drive, shipped to DDD in Cambodia via FedEx. If the hard drive option
           is chosen, DDD will absorb the cost of shipping.</para>
         </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
       </para>
      </formalpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <formalpara>
       <title>Title-Specific Markup Policies</title>
       <para>For each title, PUL shall provide the following: <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>A title-specific markup addendum clarifying unusual zoning and structural
           features;</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>A sample copy (in PDF format) marked up according to the markup policy;</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>A marked up copy of any issue(s) deviating substantially from either the general or
           title-specific markup policies.</para>
         </listitem>
        </orderedlist> DDD shall work with PUL to produce these items. Modifications to the markup
        instructions or changes to the Blue Mountain docWorks configuration must be completed before
        DDD begins work on the batch. </para>

      </formalpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <formalpara>
       <title>Descriptive Metadata for each Issue</title>
       <para>PUL shall prepare provide title, volume and issue numbers and labels, dates of
        publication, and the identifiers required by Blue Mountain as described in the reference
        documentation. PUL will deliver this metadata in MODS format, as described in the reference
        documentation (The Metadata Store). PUL will maintain the metadata store in the Blue
        Mountain Github repository; DDD shall be responsible for retrieving these files from the
        Blue Mountain GitHub repository and for updating their local copies should changes become
        necessary after production of a batch begins.</para>
      </formalpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> DDD shall process the page images and descriptive metadata into METS/ALTO, JPEG2000, and
     PDF outputs (the PRODUCT) according to the Blue Mountain docWorks configuration. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> DDD shall deliver the Product to Princeton via one of the authorized transmission media,
     as specified above. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> DDD shall issue an invoice to Princeton for EXACTLY the work performed in fulfillment of
     this batch. The Blue Mountain Project will not accept invoices that fail to specify, in detail,
     the work being billed, or that bill for work that spans discrete batches, or that entail work
     done for other Princeton-related projects. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>Princeton shall ingest the Product into its content-management system and the Veridian
     content-delivery system. Princeton shall evaluate the Product, in its raw form and in its
     deployed form, and shall notify DDD in a timely fashion of any anomalies outside the tolerances
     set forth below. </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para> Princeton shall have 30 days to request corrections. At the end of 30 days, Princeton
     shall either (a) accept the work and pay the invoice; or (b) reject the work and delete it from
     its systems. </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Schedule of Work</title>
  <para> The schedule shall be maintained as a set of milestones in the Project's Goplan tracking
   system. </para>

   <title>Quality Evaluation Guidelines</title>
   <para>When DDD has completed a batch, it shall submit output to Princeton for ingestion into
    Princeton's Veridian installation.</para>

   <para>Upon receipt of a batch, Princeton will have 30 days to accept or reject it. Princeton will
    employ the following procedures to evaluate a batch.</para>

   <procedure>
    <step>
     <title>Evaluation of Zoning and Segmentation</title>
     <para> Princeton will examine five (5) issues for zoning and segmentation errors. A zoning or
      segmentation error shall be identified using the following criteria: </para>
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>If an article is missing one or more zones, that shall count as an error.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>If an article contains one or more zones that are not part of the article in the
        original, it shall be counted as an error.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>If the sequence of zoned regions is not in the proper order, it shall count as an
        error.</para>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>
    </step>
   </procedure>

   <para>Princeton will record the results of these examinations in its report. If significant
    errors are discovered, Princeton and DDD will confer.</para>

   <procedure>
    <title>Evaluation of Headlines</title>
    <step>
     <para>Princeton will draw a random sample of 350 headlines from the batch and measure their
      accuracy by comparing each headline with its original and recording all significant errors.
      The accuracy rate of the sample should meet or exceed 99.95%.</para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <procedure>
    <title>Evaluation of Body Text</title>
    <step>
     <para>Princeton will examine the fifth article in every sample (as above) for errors in the
      body text, counting the number of significant errors that occur, where significance is as
      defined above. </para>
     <para>We shall assume an average article length of 500 words. For an accuracy rate of 90% or
      better an article should therefore contain no more than 50 significant errors.</para>
     <para>Princeton and DDD shall agree that if more than 5% of the samples from a given batch
      fail, the batch is not acceptable.</para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <procedure>
    <title>Evaluation of Metadata</title>
    <step>
     <para>Princeton will evaluate 1 random 2,000 character sampling of Issue Metadata. If the
      sample contains more than 1 error (i.e., it falls below 99.95%), the issue metadata fails and
      must be rechecked and resubmitted by DDD.</para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <procedure>
    <title>Evaluation of XML</title>
    <step>
     <para>Princeton will not verify XML validity, as docWorks automatically validates the files it
      produces against the appropriate schemas.</para>
