     - content :: editorial matter
     - folio :: Page number in a typeset text
     - IBC, IFC :: inside back cover, inside front cover
     - logo :: the name of a publication in a specific type face used

     - masthead :: the name of a publication traditionally printed at
                   the top of the first editorial page, often as a
                   logo and often accompanied by issue number and
                   date. 2) The word has evolved to encompass the box
                   that gives details of the publisher, staff and
                   contact information. Different publishers put this
                   information in different places: on the contents
                   page or on the leader page or on one of the pages
                   near the back of a magazine. Again, it is often
                   acompanied by the magazine's logo.  3) also used
                   for the logo - the name of the magazine in its
                   chosen font on the front cover.
     - OBC :: outside back cover
     - gatefold cover :: cover that folds out.
     - RH :: Right-hand (page)
     - RHFM :: righ-hand (page), facing (editorial) matter
     - TOC :: table of contents

**** Notes
     /editorial/ and /content/ are often synonymous; both mean
     non-advertising text.  /editorial/ may also be "An article
     expressing the views of the editor or publication policy."

     - DECK :: The deck is intended to tease the readers into reading
               the article. It is placed right below the title and
               above the first paragraph and is often set in bold. It
               can actually be the first paragraph of the article but
               most often, it's a separate piece of copy.
