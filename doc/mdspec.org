* General Organization
** Identifiers
   Each journal will be assigned a project number (a /bmtnid/), which
   will take the form /bmtnNNN/.  This project number will be
   maintained in a /project registry/, a file maintained with other
   administrative files.

   Each journal issue will be assigned a project number of the form
   /bmtnid-issueid/, where issueid is unspecified but will generally
   be of the form /vvnn/, expressing the volume number and issue
   number of the item. For example, the second issue in the third
   volume of /Pan/ would bear the following project number:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      bmtn031-0302
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   /One-shot/ issues (journals that published only one issue) will
   conventionally bear project numbers of the form
   /bmtnNNN-1/. Supplements, indexes, and other publications will be
   identified in some distinguishing way.

   These bmtnids will be used to compose a Universal Resource Name
   (URN) for each title and issue.

   - Journal :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnid
   - Issue :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnid-issueid

   The same URN scheme will be used to create identifiers for the
   metadata records used to encode information about the digital and
   physical items.

   - MODS Record Identifier :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:bmtnid
   - METS Document Identifier :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:td:bmtnid
   
** Journal Objects
  A /journal object/ will comprise the following elements:

  - title-level descriptive metadata :: A detailed, machine-readable description of the periodical as a whole.  Encoded in MODS for compatibility with library systems, but translatable into other formats (e.g., TEI).
  - title-level bibliography :: An article-level prose description.  (/bmtnid.tei.xml/)
  - title-level metadata wrapper :: Pulls together the title-level metadata, the bibliography, and the issue-level metadata (/bmtnid.mets.xml/)
  - issues :: one or more issues, each of which entails the following:
    - preservation-quality images :: high-quality TIFF files ('master TIFFs'), produced according to local best practices and in conformance with the FADGI standards.
    - generative image derivatives :: more manageable forms of the master TIFFs, meant to serve as the source for online deliverables, etc.  Encoded in the JPEG2000 format, according to specifications to be determined, but probably following the recommendations of the NDNP project of the Library of Congress.
    - issue-level descriptive metadata :: a MODS document.
    - text encodings :: Initially these will be in the form of corrected OCR for each page, encoded in the ALTO schema (output by ABBYY via docWORKS). Future encodings will likely include TEI representations, derived from the ALTO documents, for detailed textual analysis.
    - deliverable text-under-image PDF :: another ABBYY output format.
    - issue-level metadata wrapper :: a METS document.  The METS half of METS/ALTO, the structMap of this document links passage-level items (articles, illustrations, advertisements) to the regions identified in the ALTO documents, and to the page image.
** Arrangement
   The components of the journal object have different storage and
   access requirements.  Master TIFF files are very large binary
   files that will seldom be accessed but must be carefully preserved
   (they are expensive or impossible to replace). Image derivatives,
   too, are large binary files, but they can be regenerated from the
   master TIFFs and therefore require less care, but they will be
   accessed from a variety of sources (primarily the web).  PDF files
   are hybrids: they are large binary files, composites of image
   derivatives and OCR output that cannot easily be recreated and so
   must be preserved more carefully than image derivatives while
   still being accessible.  Metadata files are relatively small but
   very expensive to replace, and so must be curated carefully.  They
   are also liable to updating, so version tracking is important.

   The Blue Mountain Project will manage these assets separately.
   The non-binary data and metadata will be stored and managed in a
   distributed version control system (DVCS), which will enable
   change management, collaborative development among PUL and its
   METS/ALTO vendor, and resource sharing, as stipulated in the
   grant.

   Master TIFF files and text-under-image PDFs will, therefore, be
   maintained in a preservation store; image derivatives, and copies
   of the PDFs and the metadata, will be kept in an access store.

*** The Metadata Tree
    Metadata will be organized as a hierarchy of files and
    directories, like this:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - periodicals/
      - bmtnID/
	- bmtnID.mets.xml
	- bmtnID.mods.xml
	- bmtnID.tei.xml
	- issues/
	  - bmtnID-issueID/
	    - bmtnID-issueID.mets.xml
	    - bmtnID-issueID.mods.xml
	    - bmtnID-issueID.tei.xml
	    - alto/
	      - bmtnID-issueID-nnn.alto.xml     
    #+END_EXAMPLE
* Metadata Profiles
  The Blue Mountain Project aims to make its work open and
  shareable.  Doing so means adhering to standards whenever possible,
  clarifying encoding practices (in human and machine-readable forms,
  when possible), and making those practices visible to others.
** METS
*** Issue-Level
     The metadata for each issue will be encapsulated in a METS
     record.  A skeleton of such a record is the following:

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <mets xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/METS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

     #+END_SRC

** MODS
*** Title-Level Description
    The descriptive metadata for most, if not all, of the Blue
    Mountain titles has been taken from MARC records retrieved from
    Princeton's OPAC and machine-converted, then edited and enhanced
    by hand.  Here is a sample:
    #+BEGIN_SRC xml -n
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    #+END_SRC
    - The MODS record contains an [[(identifer)][<identifier>]] element whose type is
      /bmtn/.  Its value is a URN for the title, which is of the form

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      Where the string /urn:PUL:bluemountain/ is constant (for all Blue
      Mountain URNs) and BMTNID is the Blue Mountain project identifier of the
      periodical.

    - The MODS record also contains a <recordInfo> element, which
      provides a link back to the original OPAC record, as well as a
      [[(ridentifier)][<recordIdentifier>]] uniquely identifying the record itself; it is
      simply the journal URN with /dmd/ inserted into the identifier:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - The <name> elements are associated with authorities to enhance
      search and broaden the interconnectedness of the
      data.  http://viaf.org is the preferred authority;
      http://id.loc.gov should be consulted when a name is not found
      in viaf.org; if a name is found in neither, a local authority
      will be created (see later).
    - Dates are encoded in ISO standard 8601 format (see
      http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874; for an
      overview see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).  The
      extended form of the representation is preferred.
    - Subject headings will conform with existing standards in a
      manner yet to be determined.

*** Issue-Level Description
    Descriptive metadata will be encoded for the contents of each
    issue, so they may be searched and analyzed.
**** The Issue-Level Record
     Each issue-level MODS record is related to the
     title-level record /via/ a <relatedItem type='host'> element.

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
      <relatedItem type="host" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtn003">
       	<recordInfo>
	  <recordIdentifier>urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:bmtn003</recordIdentifier>
       	</recordInfo>
      </relatedItem>
     #+END_SRC

     The xlink:href shows the semantic relation between the issue and
     its host; the <recordIdentifier> is a specific key to the
     title-level record.
***** Issue Constituents
      Traditional library cataloging does not extend to the contents
      of periodicals, yet this level of description is precisely what
      is required by scholars of periodicals[fn:1], and the Blue
      Mountain Project is committed to providing it, as well as to
      formulating guidelines, in cooperation with scholars and
      librarians, for this level of description.  The specifications
      for this description, therefore, must be considered work in
      progress, work that will necessarily evolve over the course of
      the Project.

      That being said, the Project will, at the outset, capture
      information about the following sorts of constituents:

      - traditional text content (articles, features, letters to the
       	editor, etc.)
      - significant illustrations (figures, tip-ins, etc.)
      - advertisements

      The last sort -- advertisements -- is the most controversial,
      and the most difficult for librarians to understand, although
      advertisements are among the most heavily studied parts of
      historical periodicals.  There are at present no established
      rules for describing advertisements, and their variety and
      abundance pose serious practical challenges to projects with
      limited resources.  This version of the specification,
      therefore, provides little guidance on the description of
      periodicals, other than providing a framework for this level of
      detail to be created at a future date, by scholars, researchers,
      and other students of the material who wish to advance
      scholarship by enhancing the data provided here.

****** articles
       Detailed rules to follow; in general, provide title, author,
       and extent.
****** editorials
       See articles.

****** illustrations
       Where possible, provide creator.  If captioned, include as title.

****** correspondence (letters to the editor)
       These are important components of periodicals: they often
       reveal the lively exchange of opinion about important issues
       among notable individuals.  Blue Mountain may not be able to
       perform the research necessary to catalog all correspondence in
       detail, but it will create a framework for future enhancement.

** ALTO: Page-Level Description
   For each page, an encoded representation of the layout and the
   machine-readable text on the page shall be provided, using the
   ALTO schema, version 2.0 or higher, with the following
   specifications, adopted from the NDNP:

   - The text shall be encoded in the natural reading order of the
     language in which the text is written;
   - Point size and font data to at least the word level shall be included;
   - The ALTO file shall include bounding-box coordinates to at least
     the word level;
   - Non-rectangular blocks shall not be used.  Some illustrations
     may format as "tight" in the document.

** JPEG2000: Image Description
   The following specifications are taken directly from 
   /The National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) Technical Guidelines
   for Applicants/.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall conform to the JP2 file format as
     specified in ISO/IEC 15444- 1:2000 (i.e., JPEG 2000, Part 1).
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall correspond to the image that is used
     for OCR.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have a ".jp2" extension.
   - The JPEG 2000 files image X origin, image Y origin, tile X
     origin, and tile Y origin shall be 0.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall contain only one component.  The bit
     depth of that component shall be the same as the source image
     file: 1-bit for black-and-white source images, 8-bits for gray
     scale source images, and 24-bits for 24-bit color source images.
   - The tile headers of the JPEG 2000 files shall not contain coding
     style default, coding style component, quantization default, or
     quantization component marker segments.
   - The JPEG 2000 file progression order shall be RLCP (resolution,
     layer, component, position) or RLPC.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have 6 decomposition levels.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have 25 quality layers. The bits per
     pixel for each quality layer will be: 1, 0.84, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5,
     0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.21, 0.18, 0.15, 0.125, 0.1, 0.088, 0.07,
     0.0625, 0.05, 0.04419, 0.03716, 0.03125, 0.025, 0.0221, 0.018,
     0.015625.
   - The JPEG 2000 file code-block sizes will be 64x64.  The JPEG
     2000 file code-block styles shall be bypass.
   - Two compression schemes shall be used for the JPEG 2000 files.
     For 1-bit source image files, CCITT Group 4 compression
     (lossless) shall be used.  For all other bit depths, the 9-7
     irreversible filter shall be used.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall use 1024x1024 tiles.
   - The color specification of the JPEG 2000 file must be either the
     monochrome (grayscale) enumerated color space or the Monochrome
     Input restricted ICC profile.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall not contain regions of interest or
     precincts.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall not contain intellectual property
     rights information.

   To generate a JP2000 using Kakadu, use the following recipe
   (taken from /The National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) Technical Guidelines for Applicants/):
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      kdu_compress -i YOURINPUT.pgm -o YOUROUTPUT.jp2 -rate \
      1,0.84,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.4,0.35,0.3,0.25,0.21,0.18,0.15,0.125,0.1,0.088,0.0 \
      75,0.0625,0.05,0.04419,0.03716,0.03125,0.025,0.0221,0.01858,0.015625 \
      Clevels=6 Stiles={1024,1024} Corder=RLCP
   #+END_EXAMPLE
** TEI
   To be described.  TEI transcriptions will be derived from METS/ALTO
   metadata.
