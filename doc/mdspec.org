* General Organization
** Identifiers
   Each journal will be assigned a sequential /publication
   identifier/, which will take the form /bmtnNNN/, where NNN is a
   hexavigesimal number (e.g., aaa, aab, aac, etc.).[fn:2]  This publication
   id will be maintained in a /project registry/, a file maintained
   with other administrative files.

   Each journal /issue/ will be assigned a publication id of the form
   /bmtnid_issueid/, where /issueid/ corresponds to the date of
   issuance and takes the form /CCYY-MM-DD-II/, where

   - CCYY is the year of publication (e.g., 1912)
   - MM is a two-digit number representing the month of publication,
     where January = 01, February = 02, etc.  If the title and/or the
     masthead indicates a week of publication (e.g., September 8-14,
     1946), the first date should be used (e.g., September 8).
   - DD is a two-digit number representing the date of publication,
     (e.g., 01, 02 .. 30, 31).  If no date is specified, DD is 00.
   - II is a two-digit number representing the issuance number: a
     calculated number used for times when more than one issue was
     published on one day (it will usually be 01).

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      bmtnabf_1895-06-00-01
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   These bmtnids will be used to compose a Universal Resource Name
   (URN) for each title and issue.

   - Journal :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnid
   - Issue :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnid_issueid

   The same URN scheme will be used to create identifiers for the
   metadata records used to encode information about the digital and
   physical items.

   - MODS Record Identifier :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:bmtnid
   - METS Document Identifier :: urn:PUL:bluemountain:td:bmtnid

** Journal Objects
  A /journal object/ will comprise the following elements:

  - title-level descriptive metadata :: A detailed, machine-readable
       description of the periodical as a whole.  Encoded in MODS for
       compatibility with library systems, but translatable into other
       formats (e.g., TEI).

  - title-level bibliography :: An article-level prose description.
       (/bmtnid.tei.xml/)

  - title-level metadata wrapper :: Pulls together the title-level
       metadata, the bibliography, and the issue-level metadata
       (/bmtnid.mets.xml/)

  - issues :: one or more issues, each of which entails the following:
    - preservation-quality images :: high-quality TIFF files ('master
         TIFFs'), produced according to local best practices and in
         conformance with the FADGI standards.
    - generative image derivatives :: more manageable forms of the
         master TIFFs, meant to serve as the source for online
         deliverables, etc.  Encoded in the JPEG2000 format, according
         to specifications to be determined, but probably following
         the recommendations of the NDNP project of the Library of
         Congress.
    - issue-level descriptive metadata :: a MODS document.
    - text encodings :: Initially these will be in the form of
                        corrected OCR for each page, encoded in the
                        ALTO schema (output by ABBYY via
                        docWORKS). Future encodings will likely
                        include TEI representations, derived from the
                        ALTO documents, for detailed textual analysis.
    - deliverable text-under-image PDF :: another ABBYY output format.

    - issue-level metadata wrapper :: a METS document.  The METS half
         of METS/ALTO, the structMap of this document links
         passage-level items (articles, illustrations, advertisements)
         to the regions identified in the ALTO documents, and to the
         page image.

** Arrangement
   The components of the journal object have different storage and
   access requirements.  Master TIFF files are very large binary
   files that will seldom be accessed but must be carefully preserved
   (they are expensive or impossible to replace). Image derivatives,
   too, are large binary files, but they can be regenerated from the
   master TIFFs and therefore require less care, but they will be
   accessed from a variety of sources (primarily the web).  PDF files
   are hybrids: they are large binary files, composites of image
   derivatives and OCR output that cannot easily be recreated and so
   must be preserved more carefully than image derivatives while
   still being accessible.  Metadata files are relatively small but
   very expensive to replace, and so must be curated carefully.  They
   are also liable to updating, so version tracking is important.

   The Blue Mountain Project will manage these assets separately.
   The non-binary data and metadata will be stored and managed in a
   distributed version control system (DVCS), which will enable
   change management, collaborative development among PUL and its
   METS/ALTO vendor, and resource sharing, as stipulated in the
   grant.

   Master TIFF files and text-under-image PDFs will be maintained in a
   /preservation store/; image derivatives, and copies of the PDFs and
   the metadata, will be kept in an /access store./

*** The Metadata Tree
    Metadata will be organized as a hierarchy of files and
    directories, like this:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - periodicals/
      - bmtnID/
	- bmtnID.mets.xml
	- bmtnID.mods.xml
	- bmtnID.tei.xml
	- issues/
	  - bmtnid_issueid/
	    - bmtnid_issueid.mets.xml
	    - bmtnid_issueid.mods.xml
	    - bmtnid_issueid.tei.xml
	    - alto/
	      - bmtnid_issueid-nnn.alto.xml     
    #+END_EXAMPLE
* Metadata Profiles
  The Blue Mountain Project aims to make its work open and
  shareable.  Doing so means adhering to standards whenever possible,
  clarifying encoding practices (in human and machine-readable forms,
  when possible), and making those practices visible to others.
** METS
*** Issue-Level
     The metadata for each issue will be encapsulated in a METS
     record.  A skeleton of such a record is the following:
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <mets xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/METS/"
           xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

** MODS
*** Title-Level Description
    The descriptive metadata for most, if not all, of the Blue
    Mountain titles has been taken from MARC records retrieved from
    Princeton's OPAC and machine-converted, then edited and enhanced
    by hand.  Here is a sample:

    #+END_SRC
    - The MODS record contains an [[(identifer)][<identifier>]] element whose type is
      /bmtn/.  Its value is a URN for the title, which is of the form

      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE

      Where the string /urn:PUL:bluemountain/ is constant (for all
      Blue Mountain URNs) and /BMTNID/ is the Blue Mountain project
      identifier of the periodical.

    - The MODS record also contains a <recordInfo> element, which
      provides a link back to the original OPAC record, as well as a
      [[(ridentifier)][<recordIdentifier>]] uniquely identifying the record itself; it is
      simply the journal URN with /dmd/ inserted into the identifier:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       	urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:BMTNID
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - The <name> elements are associated with authorities to enhance
      search and broaden the interconnectedness of the
      data.  http://viaf.org is the preferred authority;
      http://id.loc.gov should be consulted when a name is not found
      in viaf.org; if a name is found in neither, a local authority
      will be created (see later).
    - Dates are encoded in ISO standard 8601 format (see
      http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874; for an
      overview see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).  The
      extended form of the representation is preferred.
    - Subject headings will conform with existing standards in a
      manner yet to be determined.

*** Issue-Level Description
    Descriptive metadata will be encoded for the contents of each
    issue, so the issues may be searched and analyzed.
**** The Issue-Level Record
     Each issue-level MODS record is related to the
     title-level record /via/ a <relatedItem type='host'> element.

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
      <relatedItem type="host" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaac">
       	<recordInfo>
	  <recordIdentifier>urn:PUL:bluemountain:dmd:bmtnaac</recordIdentifier>
       	</recordInfo>
      </relatedItem>
     #+END_SRC

     The xlink:href shows the semantic relation between the issue and
     its host; the <recordIdentifier> is a specific key to the
     title-level record.
**** <MODS:recordInfo>
     The <MODS:recordInfo> element shall contain a <MODS:recordIdentifier>
     subelement whose form is as follows:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:recordIdentifier>PREFIX:PUBID</MODS:recordIdentifier>
     #+END_SRC
     Where /PREFIX/ is the following fixed value:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     urn:PUL:periodicals:dmd
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     and /PUBID/ is the issue identifier, computed using the rules
     above.
**** <MODS:identifier type="PUL">
     The Princeton University Library identifier is a string composed
     as follows:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      PREFIX:PUBID
      #+END_EXAMPLE
     Where /PREFIX/ is the following fixed value:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      urn:PUL:periodicals
      #+END_EXAMPLE
     and /PUBID/ is the issue identifier, computed using the rules
     above.
**** <MODS:titleInfo>
     The <MODS:titleInfo> element shall be determined by standard
     cataloging rules.
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:titleInfo>
      <MODS:title>Broom</MODS:title>
     </MODS:titleInfo>
     #+END_SRC
**** <MODS:language>
     The <MODS:language> element shall be determined by standard
     from [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3066][rfc 3066]].
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:language>
      <MODS:languageTerm type="code" authority="rfc3066">en</MODS:languageTerm>
     </MODS:language>
     #+END_SRC
**** <MODS:part>
     The <MODS:part> element shall take the following form:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:part>
      <MODS:detail type="volume">...</MODS:detail>
      <MODS:detail type="issue">...</MODS:detail>
     </MODS:part>
     #+END_SRC
***** <MODS:detail type="volume">
      #+BEGIN_SRC xml
       <MODS:detail type="volume">
	<MODS:number>ARABICVOL</MODS:number>
	<MODS:caption>Vol. MASTHEADVOL</MODS:caption>
      </MODS:detail>
      #+END_SRC
      Where
      - ARABICVOL is the volume number expressed as a non-formatted arabic numeral (e.g., 1, 2, 3,
       ... 10, 11, ...)
      - MASTHEADVOL is the volume number as it appears in the
	masthead.
***** <MODS:detail type="issue">
      The <MODS:detail type="issue"> element shall take one of two possible
      forms:
      - For "normal" issues (i.e., those following the recorded
	sequence of publication), record both the sequential number of
	the issue as an arabic numeral and the issue number as it
	appears in the masthead:
	#+BEGIN_SRC xml
	<MODS:detail type="issue">
	 <MODS:number>ARABICISSUE</MODS:number>
	 <MODS:caption>No. MASTHEADISSUE</MODS:caption>
	</MODS:detail>
	#+END_SRC
	Where
	- ARABICISSUE is the issue number expressed as a non-formatted arabic numeral
	  (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, ...)
	- MASTHEADISSUE is the volume number as it appears in the
	  masthead. 
      - For "special" issues (e.g., supplements, etc.), for which there is no sequential number for the
	issue, the <MODS:detail type="issue"> element should take the
	following form:
	#+BEGIN_SRC xml
	<MODS:detail type="issue">
	 <MODS:caption>CAPTIONTEXT</MODS:caption>
	</MODS:detail>
	#+END_SRC
	Where /CAPTIONTEXT/ is determined using standard cataloging rules.
**** <MODS:originInfo>
     The <MODS:originInfo> element shall be used to record the date of
     issuance, as follows:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:originInfo>
      <MODS:dateIssued>MASTHEADDATE</MODS:dateIssued>
      <MODS:dateIssued encoding="iso8601" keyDate="yes">ISODATE</MODS:dateIssued>
     </MODS:originInfo>
     #+END_SRC
     Where
     - /MASTHEADDATE/ is the date as it appears in the masthead
     - /ISODATE/ is the value of the date in the masthead, expressed
       in iso8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) -- see
       http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime for details.

**** <MODS:relatedItem type="host">
     Each issue-level MODS record shall be related to the title-level
     record /via/ a <MODS:relatedItem type='host'> This element shall have
     the following fixed value:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
       <MODS:relatedItem type="host" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="urn:PUL:periodicals:bmtnabk">
	 <MODS:recordInfo>
	   <MODS:recordIdentifier>urn:PUL:periodicals:dmd:bmtnabk</MODS:recordIdentifier>
	 </MODS:recordInfo>
       </MODS:relatedItem>
     #+END_SRC

**** Issue Constituents
     Traditional library cataloging does not extend to the contents
     of periodicals, yet this level of description is precisely what
     is required by scholars of periodicals[fn:1], and the Blue
     Mountain Project is committed to providing it, as well as to
     formulating guidelines, in cooperation with scholars and
     librarians, for this level of description.  The specifications
     for this description, therefore, must be considered work in
     progress, work that will necessarily evolve over the course of
     the Project.

     That being said, the Project will, at the outset, capture
     information about the following sorts of constituents:

     - traditional text content (articles, features, letters to the
       editor, etc.)
     - significant illustrations (figures, tip-ins, etc.)
     - advertisements

     The last sort -- advertisements -- is the most controversial,
     and the most difficult for librarians to understand, although
     advertisements are among the most heavily studied parts of
     historical periodicals.  There are at present no established
     rules for describing advertisements, and their variety and
     abundance pose serious practical challenges to projects with
     limited resources.  This version of the specification,
     therefore, provides little guidance on the description of
     periodicals, other than providing a framework for this level of
     detail to be created at a future date, by scholars, researchers,
     and other students of the material who wish to advance
     scholarship by enhancing the data provided here.

***** articles
      Detailed rules to follow; in general, provide title, author,
      and extent.

***** editorials
      See articles.

***** illustrations
      Where possible, provide creator.  If captioned, include as title.

***** correspondence (letters to the editor)
      These are important components of periodicals: they often
      reveal the lively exchange of opinion about important issues
      among notable individuals.  Blue Mountain may not be able to
      perform the research necessary to catalog all correspondence in
      detail, but it will create a framework for future enhancement.

** ALTO: Page-Level Description
   For each page, an encoded representation of the layout and the
   machine-readable text on the page shall be provided, using the
   ALTO schema, version 2.0 or higher, with the following
   specifications, adopted from the NDNP:

   - The text shall be encoded in the natural reading order of the
     language in which the text is written;
   - Point size and font data to at least the word level shall be included;
   - The ALTO file shall include bounding-box coordinates to at least
     the word level;
   - Non-rectangular blocks shall not be used.  Some illustrations
     may format as "tight" in the document.

** JPEG2000: Image Description
   The following specifications are taken directly from 
   /The National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) Technical Guidelines
   for Applicants/.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall conform to the JP2 file format as
     specified in ISO/IEC 15444- 1:2000 (i.e., JPEG 2000, Part 1).
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall correspond to the image that is used
     for OCR.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have a ".jp2" extension.
   - The JPEG 2000 files image X origin, image Y origin, tile X
     origin, and tile Y origin shall be 0.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall contain only one component.  The bit
     depth of that component shall be the same as the source image
     file: 1-bit for black-and-white source images, 8-bits for gray
     scale source images, and 24-bits for 24-bit color source images.
   - The tile headers of the JPEG 2000 files shall not contain coding
     style default, coding style component, quantization default, or
     quantization component marker segments.
   - The JPEG 2000 file progression order shall be RLCP (resolution,
     layer, component, position) or RLPC.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have 6 decomposition levels.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall have 25 quality layers. The bits per
     pixel for each quality layer will be: 1, 0.84, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5,
     0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.21, 0.18, 0.15, 0.125, 0.1, 0.088, 0.07,
     0.0625, 0.05, 0.04419, 0.03716, 0.03125, 0.025, 0.0221, 0.018,
     0.015625.
   - The JPEG 2000 file code-block sizes will be 64x64.  The JPEG
     2000 file code-block styles shall be bypass.
   - Two compression schemes shall be used for the JPEG 2000 files.
     For 1-bit source image files, CCITT Group 4 compression
     (lossless) shall be used.  For all other bit depths, the 9-7
     irreversible filter shall be used.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall use 1024x1024 tiles.
   - The color specification of the JPEG 2000 file must be either the
     monochrome (grayscale) enumerated color space or the Monochrome
     Input restricted ICC profile.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall not contain regions of interest or
     precincts.
   - The JPEG 2000 files shall not contain intellectual property
     rights information.

   To generate a JP2000 using Kakadu, use the following recipe

** TEI
   To be described.  TEI transcriptions will be derived from METS/ALTO
   metadata. 

* Specifications for METS/ALTO Production
   See identifier-naming convention above; in the following section,
   /pubid/ refers to the composed identifier /bmtnid_issueid/.

** Directories and File Names
*** Image Files
    Image files shall be named /pubid_nnn.jp2/, where
    - /pubid/ is the identifier of the issue
    - /nnn/ is a three-digit number indicating the location of the
      image file in the sequence of image files (not necessarily the
      number printed on the page that has been photographed)
    - /jp2/ is the conventional file extension for JPEG2000 files.

    For example,
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk_1946090801_001.jp2
    bmtnabk_1946090801_002.jp2
    ...
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** ALTO Files
    ALTO files shall be named /pubid_nnn.alto.xml/, where
    - /pubid/ is the identifier of the issue
    - /nnn/ is a three-digit number corresponding to the sequence
      number of the image file to which this ALTO file corresponds
    - /alto/ indicates the schema used to encode the document
    - /xml/ indicates the format of the file.

    For example,
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk_1946090801_001.alto.xml
    bmtnabk_1946090801_002.alto.xml
    ...
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** METS Files
    METS files shall be named /pubid.mets.xml/, where
    - /pubid/ is the identifier of the issue
    - /mets/ indicates the schema used to encode the document
    - /xml/ indicates the format of the file.
    
    For example,
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk_1946090801.mets.xml
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** PDF Files
    PDF files shall be named /pubid.pdf/, where
    - /pubid/ is the identifier of the issue
    - /pdf/ indicates the format of the file.
    
    For example,
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk_1946090801.pdf
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Directories
    The files for an issue shall be stored in a single directory; this
    directory shall be part of a filesystem hierarchy organized by
    year, month, day, and issuance number.  For example, the files for
    Vol. 1, No. 26 (dated September 8-14, 1946) would be stored in the
    following file hierarchy:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk/
     1946/
      09/
       08_01/
	bmtnabk_1946090801_001.alto.xml
	bmtnabk_1946090801_001.jp2
	bmtnabk_1946090801_002.alto.xml
	bmtnabk_1946090801_002.jp2
	bmtnabk_1946090801.mets.xml
	bmtnabk_1946090801.pdf
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    For special issues, use the naming convention for special issues
    indicated above.  For example,
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    bmtnabk/
     1946_01/
      bmtnabk_194601_001.alto.xml
      bmtnabk_194601_001.jp2
      bmtnabk_194601_002.alto.xml
      bmtnabk_194601_002.jp2
      bmtnabk_194601.mets.xml
      bmtnabk_194601.pdf
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Metadata Profiles
*** METS
     The metadata for each issue will be encapsulated in a METS
     record.  A skeleton of such a record is the following:

     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <mets xmlns="http://www.loc.gov/METS/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

       </structMap>
   </mets>
     #+END_SRC
     Where
     - /TYPE/ is the fixed string /METAe_Serial/
     - /OBJID/ is composed as follows:
       #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       PREFIX:PUBID
       #+END_EXAMPLE
       Where
       - /PREFIX/ is the fixed string /urn:PUL:periodicals:bmtnabk/
       - /PUBID/ is the issue identifier, computed using the rules
	 above.
**** <metsHdr>
     The <metsHdr> element shall contain two elements
***** <agent>
      A constant value for all records:
      #+BEGIN_SRC xml
      <agent ROLE="CREATOR" TYPE="ORGANIZATION">
       <name>Princeton University Library, Digital Initiatives</name>
      </agent>
      #+END_SRC
***** <metsDocumentID TYPE="URN">
      Composed as follows:
      #+BEGIN_SRC xml
      <recordIdentifier>PREFIX:PUBID</recordIdentifier>
      #+END_SRC
      Where /PREFIX/ is the following fixed value:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      urn:PUL:periodicals:bmtnabk:td
      #+END_EXAMPLE
      and /PUBID/ is the issue identifier, computed using the rules
      above.

**** LABEL attributes
     Use the <mods:caption> elements from the MODS record (described below)
     for Volume and Issue numbers.

**** Dates
     Use the <mods:dateIssued> element /without/ the keydate attribute
     for display dates.

*** MODS
    The Blue Mountain Project shall supply preliminary MODS records
    for every issue to be encoded in METS/ALTO.  These records shall
    adhere to the MODS profile detailed above.  METS/ALTO producers
    shall be responsible for incorporating these MODS records /in
    their entirety/ into the METS records they produce.

**** <MODS:relatedItem type="constituent">
     Articles, Illustrations, and other identified sections of a
     magazine shall be encoded as <MODS:relatedItem
     type="constituent"> elements in MODS:
     #+BEGIN_SRC xml
     <MODS:relatedItem type="constituent" ID="c01">
      <MODS:titleInfo>
       <MODS:title>Calendar of the Week</MODS:title>
      </MODS:titleInfo>
      <MODS:typeOfResource>text</MODS:typeOfResource>
      <MODS:language>

	<MODS:list>6-7</MODS:list>
       </MODS:extent>
      </MODS:part>
     </MODS:relatedItem>
     #+END_SRC
     - The ID attribute on the <MODS:relatedItem> element may be any valid
       XML ID (must begin with a character, etc.)
     - The <MODS:title> is transcribed as it appears on the page.
     - <MODS:TypeOfResource> should have a value of either /text/ or /still
       image/ (for illustrations).
     - The <MODS:languageTerm> values should be derived from the
       ISO639-2 standard, found at
       http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/.  The code form should
       be used.
     - The <MODS:extent> records the page or pages on which the item
       appears:
       - a single page number for an item that appears on only one page
       - a range (n-m) for an item that appears on sequential pages
       - a series (n; m) for an item that appears on non-sequential pages
       - a combination of the above (e.g., /1-2; 5/ for an article
	 that starts on page one, continues on page 2, and then skips
	 to page 5).
